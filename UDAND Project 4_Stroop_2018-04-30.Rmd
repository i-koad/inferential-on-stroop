## Abstract
This project paper has been prepared under Udacity's Inferential Statistics 
course. The project calls for investigating the [Stroop Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect) by statistically 
examining results from a sample of participants.

A hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task will be proposed and tested 
against the data set.

## Variables

The dependent variable is the time taken to complete each test, while the 
independent variable is the words condition (congruent or incongruent).

## Hypotheses

It is assumed that for this project, the dataset will contain a sample of all 
the individuals who have taken the Stroop test.

[Source](https://nces.ed.gov/blogs/nces/post/statistical-concepts-in-brief-how-and-why-does-nces-use-sample-surveys)

With no information on the population parameters, the set of hypotheses and the 
corresponding statistical analysis will be based on sample testing in order 
to make inferences about the population. 

In this case, I am attempting to analyze if there is a difference in time 
to call out the ink colour of Incongruent and Congruent words.

Hence, the null hypothesis is that the time taken to name the ink colour of 
congruent words within the population, is the same as that taken for the 
incongruent words. 

The alternative hypothesis proposes that the time taken to name ink colours 
of the congruent and incongruent words is different, within the population.

The hypotheses can be symbolized as follows:

$H_0: \mu_{inc} = \mu_{con}$ 

$H_A: \mu_{inc} \neq \mu_{con}$

where,

$\mu_{inc}$ is the population mean for Inconguent words condition task,  
$\mu_{con}$ is the population mean for Congruent words condition task.

The statistical test will be a dependent t-test for paired samples: 

1. t-test is chosen (as opposed to z-test) since there is no information on the population's standard deviation, and no means to derive the information. 

2. Dependent t-test is proposed (as opposed to independent t-test) since the 
resulting times are drawn from the same population.

Several assumptions are made in order to use t-test on the samples provided by 
the dataset:

1. samples from the dataset have been randomly drawn from the population

2. pairs of observations (i.e. the pair of duration taken to name ink colour of 
congruent and incongruent words) are independent

3. the distribution of the mean difference is normal

I will use 2-tailed t-critical values in order to fit the 
alternative hypothesis which is non-directional (i.e. $\mu_{inc}$ could either 
increase or decrease in relation to $\mu_{con}$).

The significance level, i.e. alpha is set at 0.05.

I will also examine the sample's *Cohen's d* to evaluate the effect 
size.

#### My Experience with Stroop Task
The Stroop task testing comprises calling out the name of colour used to mark 
each word, and timing the duration taken to complete naming the colours for a 
fixed quantity of words.

The test starts with congruent words condition before finishing with the 
incongruent words condition.

I took longer to complete the task with incongruent words condition. Did other 
participants experience the same?

***

## Descriptive Statistics

```{r Load the data, echo=FALSE}
setwd("~/UDAND/Proj 4_Stroop Test/")
sp <- read.csv("stroopdata.csv")

str(sp)
```

The dataset contains time entries for 24 participants, i.e. sample size is 24.

#### Central Tendency

```{r}
summary(sp)
```

So, it appears other participants in the sample had the same experience - 
the measures of central tendency (median and mean) for Incongruent are higher 
than the Congruent values. On average, the Incongruent task took almost 
8 seconds longer to complete than its counterpart.

#### Variability

```{r}
sp %>% summarise(IQR_cgrt = IQR(sp$Congruent), 
                 IQR_incgrt = IQR(sp$Incongruent), 
                 var_cgrt = var(sp$Congruent), 
                 var_incgrt = var(sp$Incongruent), 
                 stdev_cgrt = sd(sp$Congruent), 
                 stdev_incgrt = sd(sp$Incongruent))
```

Abbr. | Meaning
---|---
IQR | Inter-quartile Range
var | Variance
stdev | Standard Deviation
cgrt | Congruent words condition 
incgrt | Incongruent words condition


Incongruent words condition task in the sample results has a larger spread 
(variability) - all three measures of variability in the sample indicate 
longer duration (seconds) compared to Congruent task.

## Visualizations

```{r}
sp_melt <- melt(sp, 
                variable.name = "words_cond", 
                value.name = "time")
```

```{r Histogram faceted by words condition type, fig.width=5, fig.height=3}
ggplot(data = sp_melt, aes(x = time)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2) +
  facet_wrap(~ words_cond, ncol = 1) +
  xlab("Task completion time (s)") +
  ylab("Number of participants") + 
  ggtitle("Stroop Task")

```

The histogram plot for Congruent task approximates to a normal distribution. 
On the other hand, the Incongruent task histogram suggests a positively skewed 
distribution. 

The normal distribution for Congruent task seems to represent a collection of 
the candidates that have a spread of reaction time and literacy prowess. Both 
these capabilities can be improved with practice to reduce the task 
completion time. I expect this to be the distribution too if an entire literate population took the test on Congruent words condition.

However, the skewed distribution observed in the Incongruent task suggests 
that this test is an "equalizer" in the sense that even the more quick to read 
and react could not reduce the completion time beyond a floor value 
(~ 18 seconds).


```{r Boxplot, fig.width=5, fig.height=3}
ggplot(data = sp_melt, aes(x = words_cond, y = time)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  xlab("Words Condition Type") +
  ylab("Task completion time (s)") + 
  ggtitle("Stroop Task")
```

The plots illustrate a clear difference in completion time between the
tasks with differing words condition - Incongruent words condition tasks take 
a longer time to complete compared to tasks with Congruent words condition.

An interesting observation is that the Congruent boxplot's median line lies in 
the upper half of the "box" in the dataset suggesting that notable handful 
of individuals (i.e. 25% of samples) in the dataset that could complete the task faster. Contrast this with the median line of the Incongruent boxplot which 
lies in the middle of the "box" - suggesting that the previously quick 
individuals could not do notably better in completing the Incongruent task as 
they did in the Congruent task.

```{r Remove outliers, fig.width=5, fig.height=3}
not_slow_melt <- melt(subset(sp, Incongruent < 30), 
                      variable.name = "words_cond", 
                      value.name = "time")
ggplot(data = not_slow_melt, aes(x = words_cond, y = time)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  xlab("Words Condition Type") +
  ylab("Task completion time (s)") + 
  ggtitle("Stroop Task")
```

By filtering away the slowest participants from the dataset (i.e. completion 
time exceeding 30 seconds), we can see a more striking difference in the 
performance of "quick" individuals between the two tasks. 

So, how did each individual do between the 2 tasks?  

```{r Scatterplot, fig.width=5, fig.height=3}
ggplot(data = sp, aes(x = Congruent, y = Incongruent)) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Incongruent over Congruent") + 
  xlab("Congruent task (seconds)") +
  ylab("Incongruent task (seconds)")
```

There is a correlation between the time taken for the Congruent and Incongruent 
tasks.

Surprisingly, the individuals who took the longer time (> 30s) to finish the 
Incongruent task were not the slower indivdiuals in the Congruent task. 

Let's filter these individuals out, and re-plot with a fitted line.

```{r Scatterplot filtered, fig.width=5, fig.height=3}
ggplot(data = subset(sp, Incongruent < 30), 
       aes(x = Congruent, y = Incongruent)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 24, 4)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(10, 30, 4)) +
  ggtitle("Incongruent over Congruent") + 
  xlab("Congruent task (seconds)") +
  ylab("Incongruent task (seconds)")
```

```{r Correlation}
with(subset(sp, Incongruent < 30), 
     cor(x = Congruent, y = Incongruent))
```

A weak to moderate correlation of 0.47 between the times taken to complete 
the 2 tasks. In other words, almost half of the variation in 
Incongruent task completion time can be explained by the variation in 
Congruent task completion time.

## Statistical Testing
Recall that the hypotheses are as follows:  

$H_0: \mu_{inc} = \mu_{con}$  

$H_A: \mu_{inc} \neq \mu_{con}$

To establish if we should reject the null or if we fail to reject the null, 
we take the following steps:

##### 1. Establish the sample size

```{r}
(n <- length(sp$Incongruent)
 )
```

$n = 24$  

##### 2. Establish the mean difference  
$\mu_d = \mu_{inc} - \mu_{con}$

```{r}
(mean_diff <- with(sp, mean(Incongruent) - mean(Congruent))
 )
```

$\mu_d = 7.96$

##### 3. Establish standard deviation of difference  
$S_d = \sqrt{\frac{\sum{(d_i - \mu_d)^2}}{n-1}}$  
$\text{ ,where } d_i \text{ is the difference for pair } i$

```{r Standard Deviation of Difference}
# Difference for pairs
sp$diff <- with(sp, Incongruent - Congruent)

sp$deviate_mean_2 <- with(sp, (diff - mean_diff)^2
                               )

# Std deviation of difference
(SD_diff <- sqrt(sum(sp$deviate_mean_2) / (n - 1))
  )

```

$S_d = 4.86$

##### 4. Establish the standard error of mean (SE)  

$\text{SE} = \frac{S_d}{\sqrt{n}}$

```{r}
(SE <- SD_diff/sqrt(n))
```

$\text{SE} = 0.99$

##### 5. Establish the t-statistics  
t-statistics = $\frac{\mu_d}{\text{SE}}$

```{r}
(t <- mean_diff / SE)
```

t-statistics = 8.02

##### 6. Degree of freedom based on dependent t-test of paired samples
d.f. = n - 1 = 23

##### 7. Establish the 2-tailed t-critical value based on alpha of 0.05  
```{r}
(t_critical <- qt(1-0.05/2, 23)
 )
```

t-critical(23) = $\pm2.069, p<.025$

***

##### 8. Test results

We can see that t-statistics (8.02) lies beyond the t-critical value 
(+/- 2.069). Thus, we can reject the null hypothesis. 

***

#### 95% Confidence Intervals of Mean Difference between the 2 Words Conditions

Establishing the Margin of Error using 2-tailed t-test with alpha of 0.05. 

Margin of Error = t~critical~ x SE

```{r}
(MoErr <- t_critical * SE
 )
```

Margin of Error = 2.05

Hence, the 95% confidence intervals for the difference in time (seconds) taken 
to complete the Congruent and Incongruent words condition tasks are:

```{r}
mean_diff - MoErr
mean_diff + MoErr
```

95% CI [5.91, 10.02].

***

## Effect Size

*Cohen's d* is derived by the following formula:  

$\text{Cohen's d} = \frac{\mu_i - \mu_c}{S_d} = \frac{\mu_d}{S_d}$

```{r}
mean_diff / SD_diff
```

$\text{Cohen's d} = 1.64$

The distance between means is more than 0.8 standardized unit away from one 
another which represents a large effect size.

***

## Conclusion

Based on t-test result, we can reject the null hypothesis to accept that 
the alternate hypothesis has statistical significance.

Simply put, the t-test result indicates that any individual taking the Stroop 
test are likely to take different times in naming the ink colour of congruent 
versus incongruent words.

*Cohen's d* value indicates that there is meaningful effect size in the mean difference.

The result matches with observations made through the histograms and boxplots 
illustrating the difference in time taken for the 2 task types.

#### Further Thoughts

The Stroop effect is theorized to be the manifestation of a race condition in 
the brain where both relevant (i.e. actual colour used on the word) and 
irrelevant (i.e. the word with name of colour) information are processed in 
parallel, but race to enter the processing centre of the brain when a response 
(i.e. when verbalizing the colour's name) made.

Multi-tasking could result in similar effect. For instance, individuals 
attempting to drive a vehicle while engaging in a conversation on a cellular 
phone might actually be responding slower to inputs from either task, thus 
compromising on road safety and simultaneously coming across as inattentive or 
uninterested to the caller on the other line.
